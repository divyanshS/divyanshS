### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹
**I am Divyansh Sharma**. by profession, I am software developer; a pragmatic programmer, specifically working as a Tech Lead. I'm not only interested in developing or writing just code, rather I also like to design and architect the product.

:100:*Something I really believe in is: "Softwares and Languages are just tools, the crux lies in the design and UX with the right empathy"*.:100:

From time to time, I have done hand-on multiple technologies. Some for a short duration, some for big projects, I have worked in Python, Django, JavaScript, ReactJS, Async-frameworks like Celery, Databases, etc...
I am an analytical thinker and I like to solve problems and design solutions. I believe in keeping the right focus on UX and the end user's behavior/expectations for developing the best quality product.

My goal is to design and deliver great products with the best usability experience.
